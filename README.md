This article presents a method and a tool for exploring visual collections, drawing on symbolic connections, through the use of data processing and interactive data visualisation. The approach is deeply inspired by the work of Aby Warburg, particularly by his Mnemosyne Atlas project. Building on this foundation, we introduce Aventura.js, an open-source, bilingual JavaScript library developed by one of the authors as a tool to create interactive symbolic panels connected by hypertextual links and interpretations.

Following the structure of the Journal, the article is organised in three complementary layers: the narrative layer of the article presents the context and the epistemological principles originally proposed by Warburg on his Mnemosyne Atlas project at the beginning of the XX century, and also reflects on how to expand Warburg's strategies on new ways by using digital tools. We discuss the necessity of specialised tools to visualise qualitative data in image corpora within the humanities. The hermeneutic layer of the article details the development of Aventura.js as an electronic literature library and its experimental repurposing as a tool for digital visual scholarship. Subsequently, we demonstrate how this programming library can be used to create interactive exploratory panels and atlases that embody and extend the conceptual possibilities of Warburgâ€™s approach. Concretely, these panels and atlases are organised in feature spaces and hypertextual tours derived from persistent visual motifs.

As a case study, we apply our method and tool to a dataset of images related to the *Carguero* (Man carrier), a figure prominent in 19th century Colombian visual culture. This case is drawn from the doctoral dissertation of one of the authors, where the tool was first experimentally employed as a part of a broader research project. We show how focusing attention on symbolic figures or details, rather than authors, works or genres, can offer deeper insights into the trajectories of images across various visual regimes, geographic spaces, and historical periods. This process includes creating a collection, annotating images, filtering, automating montage, presentation and interactivity, and making design decisions for the final interactive atlas. Lastly, we critically evaluate the strength and limitations of this method and tool and possible further developments.
