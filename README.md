In this article we propose a methodology and a tool for exploring visual collections, based on the interrelations of historical and iconographic connections, through the use of interactive storytelling. Such methodology is strongly inspired by the work of the art historian Aby Warburg and, most especifically, by his Atlas Mnemosyne project; in this line, we propose a way of using an open source, bilingual, JavaScript library called Aventura.js to create interactive iconographic panels connected by hypertextual connections and interpretations. Following the structure of the Journal, the article is organized in three complementary layers: the narrative layer of the article presents the context and the epistemological principles originally proposed by Warburg on his Atlas Mnemosyne project at the beginning of the XX century, and also reflects on how to expand Warburg's strategies on new ways by using digital tools. We discuss the need to develop specific tools to visualize qualitative data in image corpuses in humanities and social sciences. The hermeneutic layer of the article presents the development of Aventura.js as an electronic literature library, and its repurposing as a tool for visual digital scholarship. Subsequently we propose how this programming library can be used to create interactive exploratory panels that follow the spirit and extend the meaning possibilities of the Atlas Mnemosyne strategy. Concretely, panels organized in a 2D feature space according to categories related to the persistence, or survival, of iconographic motifs in collective memory, but, additionally, organized in a hipertextual, narrative z-dimension. As a case study that uses our methodology and tool, we provide an example dataset consisting in a collection of images that are iconographically related to the figure of the “Carguero” (Man carrier), a typical character of the 19th century Colombian visual culture. We will show how focusing attention on figures, characters or iconographic details (instead of authors, works or genres) by means of data filtering, visualization, and narrativization, allows a better understanding of the images' trajectories through different visual regimes, geographical spaces and historical periods. With this dataset, we develop all the steps involved in the design of an Atlas containing multiple interactive panels: the creation of a collection, the annotation of the images, the automation of montage and interacivity, the construction of a narrative space through the use of hypertextextual paths, and the final design decisions. Additionally we critically discuss the reach and limitations of this methodology and tool and possible further developments.
